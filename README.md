# File-Management-System

## Overview
Many companies use File-Management to manage their work, but there are some problems to deal with, such as Unencrypted files being stored, requests are not accepted, all requests for files being delayed, and the system is not scalable to increase user numbers and get detailed system logs.
With this File-Management, It is easy to give permissions to users, and your files are protected, and you can encrypt them while they are stored, so every action in the system will be logged. Your work will be easier if you have a full version control system for your files.
